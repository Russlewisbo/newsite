**This section of the course will be divided into three 3 hr modules**

**In Module 1** the student will examine the challenges for global management of antimicrobial resistance. The dynamics and problems of cross-border dissemination and control of antimicrobial resistance outbreaks will be discussed and well as control strategies. Students will participate in group simulation exercise managing the emergence of a hypervirulent pan-drug resistant bacteria strain in a healthcare setting as a cross-border threat to heath. The exercise will provide an opportunity for students to discuss knowledge, capabilities, experiences and best practices used to control cross-boarder resistance threats.
<br>

**In Module 2** the student will study the current crises on antibiotic development, how markets, regulatory agencies, and clinical practice models impact antibiotic development, and then compare and contrast strategies that have been proposed to stimulate development of new antibiotics. Students will then participate in a simulation exercise where they will compare how incentive strategies may differ depending on the the type and expected use of a novel antibiotic.
<br>

**In Module 3** the student will examine the problems of antimicrobial availability, affordability and quality in resource limited countries. Innovative programs such as the Medicine Patents Pool and the WHO Coronavirus Technology Access Pool will be discussed as models for improved access. Students will present group case studies of how access to medications for HIV infection, hepatitis C, COVID-19, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have been improved through these programs.
