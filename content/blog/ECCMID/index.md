**Abstract** <br> <br>

**Background:** Time to positivity (TTP) and differential time-to-positivity (DTP) of central line vs. peripheral cultures are surrogate indicators for microbial inoculum and frequently investigated as prognostic or diagnostic markers in patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs). However, evidence concerning the prognostic or diagnostic utility of TTP and DTP is conflicting.
**Methods:** We performed a systematic review of bacterial and fungal BSIs studies that reported the association between (i) TTP and patient survival; or (ii) DTP and diagnosis of central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Our search identified 32 TTP and 29 DTP studies eligible for analysis. Meta-analysis was performed using Bayesian approaches to generate pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROCs) for TTP and DTP studies. Sensitivity analysis was performed using different TTP cut-offs, by pathogen group, and prospective vs. retrospective study design.
**Results:** Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates for TTP and patient mortality were low (sens 0.59, 97.5% CI 0.52-0.67 and spec 0.66, 0.58-0.73). TTP did not differentiate non-surviving patients (SROC 0.434, 0.39-0.47). The prognostic utility of TTP did not significantly change by patient subgroup analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates for DTP for the diagnoses of CLABSIs were 0.78, 0.70-0.81 and 0.85, 0.78-0.87 respectively (Figure 1). DTP discriminated between non-CLABSI vs. CLABSI with a pooled SROC of 0.637 (0.59-0.67). A “negative” DTP would be predicted to achieve negative predictive values > 90% when the prevalence of CLABSI is ≤ 25%.
**Conclusions:** TTP is predicted to be a poor prognostic marker for patient survival, while DTP has diagnostic utility for “ruling-out” CLABSI when the expected prevalence of CLABSI is <25%. Additional studies are needed to further explore the relationship of TTP for other clinical endpoints including persistent infection, treatment relapse or failure.
