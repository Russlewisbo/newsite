title: "The Changing Landscape of Hematological Malignancy Treatment:"
subtitle: "Implications for antifungal therapy"
excerpt: "The transformational changes in treatment for hematological malignancies has created new challenges for understanding the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. Many small kinase inhibitors are metabolized by CYPP450 3A4 and have potential for QT prolongation, making concurrent use with firstline antifungals (triazoles) used for prophylaxis and treatment difficult. In this presentation we explore some of the key issues with newer therapies, and the potential emerging role of isavuconazole to improve the safety of triazole therapy when patients are receiving small molecule kinase inhibitors"
