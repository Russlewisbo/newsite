title: "Beyond antifungal MICs: Fungicidal activity, biofilms and tissue distribution"
subtitle: "32nd ECCMID, Lisbon, Portugal"
excerpt: "Many factors beyond the MIC can impact the activity of antifungal agents. In this talk, I provide an overview of the importance of fungicidal activity, how biofilms and persister cells contribute to resistance that is not measured by the MIC, and then address the challenged of understanding antifungal PK/PD for deep tissue infections."
