![](/img/RLEWIS.jpg)

I am a clinical pharmacist and Associate Professor of Infectious Diseases (MED/17) in the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences at the University of Bologna. I earned my Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree from the University of Kansas, followed by post-graduate clinical residency training at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. I then completed an infectious diseases research fellowship at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa with a focus on antifungal pharmacology. <br> <br> I have over 20 years experience in laboratory and clinical research of antimicrobial pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in immunocompromised hosts. My current research focuses on the development of prognostic risk models and decision support tools for the diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections and multidrug resistant bacteria. I also serve as a Senior PK/PD Editor for the *Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy*- the official journal of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.<br> <br> Outside of work hours, my free time is spent with his wife Marta, son Marco, dog Luli, ...and riding an old racing bicycle up and down the [colli bolognesi](https://collibologna.it).
