 **My brief biography** <br> <br>After receiving my Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree from the University of Kansas, I completed a one-year clinical pharmacy residency at Barnes-Jewish Hospital /Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis, Missouri. I then completed a two-year research fellowship in infectious diseases at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. After completion of my training, I joined the faculty of the Unviersity of Houston College of Pharmacy and a tenure track faculty and served as a clinical pharmacist/ preceptor on the Infectious Diseases Consultation Service at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. 
  After 11 years in Houston, I married and Italian hematologist (Marta Stanzani) and relocated to Bologna, Italy where I subsequent joined the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences in Medicine at the University of Bologna. When I am not working, I like to relax with hikes with my family or long bike rides in the *colli bolognese.*
