      <description>Polymorphisms in genes encoding fungal pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system are associated with increased risk of invasive aspergillosis (IA), but incorporation genetic risk factors in clinical decision making remains limited. We propose to develop a combined clinical/genetic risk model suitable for accurately predicting an individual patient&amp;rsquo;s risk for developing IA within 60 days of admission for chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (AML/MDS). We will develop a clinical risk model from a large data registry of 788 patients over 2,713 hospital admissions (2007-2020) for AML/MDS treatment that was associated with a 5.</description>
